There once was a kid named Nial. He enjoyed playing video games and was good at them

Nial loved playing horror games especially. However, despite being so good at horror games, he was deadly afraid of anything supernatural. One night when he was playing a game, he heard consecutive knocks at his door....

Flustered, Nial slowly approached the door. As he reached for the doorknob with a shaking hand, three more consecutive knocks banged from the other side. Nial jumped back. "OPEN UP!" boomed a deep, raspy voice.
Nial, being not very intelligent, opened the door to... a scary clown! The clown told Nial he needed to buy him Ian's pizza. However, Nial thought the voice sounded familiar. He grabbed the clown's face and ripped it off to reveal his brother.

Angry, Nial dragged his younger brother back to his house in order to expose his brother's behavior to his parent's once and for all. After travelling all the way there, he did not get the reaction he anticipated and instead found that his parents simply laughed at him and told him to focus on his studies more than making up ridicilous stories.
