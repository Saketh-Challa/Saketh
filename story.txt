There once was a kid named Nial. He enjoyed playing video games and was good at them

Nial loved playing horror games especially. However, despite being so good at horror games, he was deadly afraid of anything supernatural. One night when he was playing a game, he heard consecutive knocks at his door....

Flustered, Nial slowly approached the door. As he reached for the doorknob with a shaking hand, three more consecutive knocks banged from the other side. Nial jumped back. "OPEN UP!" boomed a deep, raspy voice.
