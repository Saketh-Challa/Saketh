There once was a kid named Nial. He enjoyed playing video games and was good at them

Nial loved playing horror games especially. However, despite being so good at horror games, he was deadly afraid of anything supernatural. One night when he was playing a game, he heard consecutive knocks at his door....

Flustered, Nial slowly approached the door. As he reached for the doorknob with a shaking hand, three more consecutive knocks banged from the other side. Nial jumped back. "OPEN UP!" boomed a deep, raspy voice.
Nial, being not very intelligent, opened the door to... a scary clown! The clown told Nial he needed to buy him Ian's pizza. However, Nial thought the voice sounded familiar. He grabbed the clown's face and ripped it off to reveal his brother.
